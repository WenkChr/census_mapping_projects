These projects were created to aid the map production team for the 2021 census and this repo contains two separate projects

1.) cb_update_maps

2.) nt_augmentation

Each of the above projects were built using arcpy and arcmap both of with are ESRI proucts and therefore a valid advanced licence for the software is required.
