### Cenesus Mapping

## Description
These projects were created to aid the map production team for the 2021 census and this repo contains two separate projects

* cb_update_maps
* nt_augmentation

Each of the above projects were built using arcpy and arcmap both of with are ESRI proucts and therefore a valid advanced licence for the software is required to perform the mapping tasks via these scripts.

### cb_update_maps

This project takes new cb geometry and places it under the old cb geometry so that only changes are visible. This is
done so that it is obvious where updates have occured. 

### nt_augmentation

This project augments census maps with open data from the Northwest Territories ATLAS site in an effort to make the
maps more readable. Colour changes were also made to certain standard layers to aid in the readability effort.
